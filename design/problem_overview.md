# Problem Overview #

## 1 Description ##

Figuring out how much money everyone owes in a group outing is often a difficult process. Bill Splitter makes this process easier by providing a simple interface for the group to list everything that was purchased and split the costs. 

## 2 Key Goals and Purpose ##

+ Automatically split the bill based on who ordered/purchased what items, and calculate the amount of money each person is responsible for. If you split and item, automatically figure out the cost based on an equal splitting of the item.
+ Keep track of how much money every person has paid, so that the entire bill is paid for.
+ Keep track of whether someone paid more or less than their portion and whether they owe money or are owed money.
+ Send email summaries and reminders to members of the group so everyone knows their costs and payments.

## 3 Motivation ##

+ The app has a simple user interface and accomplishes much more than just evenly splitting a bill. It allows for different people to share items and seamlessly includes parts of items in its calculation.
+ While apps such as PayPal and Venmo allow friends to pay each other, they don't deal with the splitting of costs, nor do they keep track of people oweing each other money.
