+ **Invite your friends to a group.** For every event with your friends, invite them to a group to figure out who owes what. Every group is self-contained. No one else can see your group's details unless you invite them to the group.

+ **Easily and seamlessly split bills.** Everyone in your group can add the items ordered to the group. Before paying, make sure that everything is accounted for. BillSplitter will automatically tell everyone what they owe, taking into things like tax and tip.

+ **Easily and seamlessly split each item.** Sometimes, a portion of the group shares an item, and a different portion of the group shares another item. Eliminate the confusion of who is responsible for what, by specifying the group memebers that took a part of each item. BillSplitter will split the cost of each item across the people that got it, and add up individual totals.

+ **Spot your friends.** Didn't bring enough cash? Don't worry! With BillSplitter, you can specify the amount that you actually paid. BillSplitter keeps track of the total amount of money in the pool, and lets everyone know if they paid more or less than their share.

+ **Remind yourself of the amount owed to friends.** At the end of the day, everyone will be emailed a summary of their items purchased and costs. If you owe others money or are owed money, you'll be reminded so that you can remember to follow up with them later.
